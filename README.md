# Haikus for Codespaces

This project demonstrates a gamified re-migration simulation using Python and JavaScript. It models population neutrality by 2045, based on demographic data and ethical principles (S³ Formula: Self-Sufficiency, Self-Governance, Self-Propagation).

## Features
- **Python Simulation:** Console-based re-migration model with HACCP-like controls, crime reduction, and score system.
- **Browser Game (GreenMob.html):** Interactive JS version with pie charts, levels, and achievements – run it directly in the browser!
- Ethical Advantages: Aligns with Sharia (repentance over punishment) and Christian values (conditional mercy).
- Efficiency: Social costs to zero, saving billions for structures (e.g., 500 Bn € instead of wars).

## How to Run
1. **Browser Version (Recommended):** Open [GreenMob.html](GreenMob.html) for the interactive game. Enter parameters, click "Next Level" to advance years.
2. **Python Version:** Install dependencies (`pip install pandas numpy pygame`), run `python simulation_game.py`. Inputs for rates, console output with table and score.
